simpleGal
=========

A simple image gallery plug-in

Copy the mark-up in the demo and call the plug-in as follows:

<pre><code>$('#thumbnails').simpleGal();</code></pre>

**Note:** There are several ways that this plug-in could be improved and I am currently working on these issues. Also, this documentation and demo will be improved when I have resolved these issues.
